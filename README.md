# Everlane Shopping System
This is a small project for a simple shopping cart system.
## Setup
The program is built in python with postgresql.
The database is already running on the server so you don't have to
do anything with setting it up. Just clone this repo, install psycopg2 from
requirements.txt. Once you are done with that step, run `python shop.py`
## Database Structure
There are three tables in the database and here are there initial state:
#### Products
id | price  |  title  | available_inventory|
---|--------|---------|--------------------|
 1 | 100.99 | shirt   |                  30|
 2 |  40.99 | skirt   |                  12|
 3 | 200.50 | shoes   |                   0|
